Trajectory optimization of hypersonic reentry vehicle>

Entry vehicle: need to put real value for cav thrust, ISP  

Aerodynamic coefficient taken from CAV-H basic data, same goes for the BC

isacalc package (https://github.com/LukeDeWaal/ISA_Calculator.git) dependency for earth atmosphere parameters

In entry dynamics could not define the control input u and thrust_3dof

This code refers a good amount work from the EDLpy(https://github.com/CDNoyes/EDL-Py.git) library
